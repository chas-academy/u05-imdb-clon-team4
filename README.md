# Group policy and work ethics

All group members are expected to attend stand-ups (as of now, Mondays @ 1 PM) and other meetings assigned by the group as a whole.

This being said we are all people with personal lives and unexpected things can happen. If for whatever reason any team member can not attend a meeting or is in risk of missing a deadline it is important that you take personal responsibility and contact the group in the designated slack group channel.

Other than that, happy hacking ðŸ¤©

## Standards and conventions

-   PHP version: 8.0.1 or newer
-   Indentation: 2 tabs / 4 spaces

Additionally, we want to follow popular/common practices and conventions. Sources to those highlighted below are [PHP_FIG - PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [Laravel Best Practices (Repo)](https://github.com/alexeymezenin/laravel-best-practices#follow-laravel-naming-conventions).
