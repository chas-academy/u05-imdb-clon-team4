# Group policy and work ethics

All group members are expected to attend stand-ups (as for now on Mondays 1 PM) and other meetings assigned by the group as a whole.

This being said we are all people with personal lives and unexpected things can happen. If for whatever reason any team member can not attend a meeting or is in risk of missing a deadline it is important that you take personal responsibility and contact the group in the designated slack group channel.

Other than that, happy hacking ðŸ¤©
